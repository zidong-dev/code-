The above program files are the simulation programs used for the switching and detection described in this paper. Below is a brief introduction to the functions of each program:

switching A: Source program for achieving magnetization switching via an external magnetic field with the initial state set as A.
switching B: Source program for achieving magnetization switching via an external magnetic field with the initial state set as B.
switching C: Source program for achieving magnetization switching via an external magnetic field with the initial state set as C.
switching D: Source program for achieving magnetization switching via an external magnetic field with the initial state set as D.
detect: Source program for Néel vector detection under the action of a circularly polarized microwave field.
NiF₂-detection: Source program for Néel vector detection under the action of a linearly polarized microwave field.
